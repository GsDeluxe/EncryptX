## Features

    • AES-128 Encryption.
    • CLI and GUI interface.

## Why I used AES encrytion

I chose to implement AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption for my password manager due to its widely recognized reputation for robust security and reliability. As a crucial aspect of any password management system, data protection is paramount to safeguarding sensitive information. AES encryption employs a symmetric key algorithm, ensuring that my passwords are securely encrypted and decrypted using the same key. This allows for efficient and fast encryption and decryption processes while maintaining a high level of security. Additionally, AES has undergone extensive scrutiny and testing by cryptographic experts worldwide, making it one of the most trustworthy encryption methods available.

## How do I use the program?

Download the password manager through the releases. It will be a exe file and all you need to do is run it and everything should work. If you encounter any issues please open a issue!

Otherwise you can download the python file on its own and run the command below:

`pip install tabulate colorama cryptography pyperclip keyboard customtkinter`

After you have ran this command you can now open the python file and everything should work (You NEED Python installed).

There is no actuall release yet as its constantly being worked on and there is still features missing! (The main features do work e.g storing, viewing and the removal of passwords)
