# Bacon-Manager
This is a password manager im using for a school project it is made in python and has AES encryption to ensure data is stored securely! It allows users to use either CLI or GUI by just choosing one on startup.

# How do I use the program?

Download the password manager through the releases. It will be a exe file and all you need to do is run it and everything should work. If you encounter any issues please open a issue!

Otherwise you can download the python file on its own and run the command below:

`pip install tabulate colorama cryptography pyperclip keyboard`

There is no actuall release yet as its constantly being worked on and there is still features missing! (The main features do work e.g storing, viewing and the removal of passwords)
